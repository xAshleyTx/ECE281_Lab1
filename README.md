### Results
1. I created a truth table to show the expected results of the circuit.
2. My testbench ran the actual results of the system I created when inputting the same A,B,C values
2. My testbench waveform matched the results of the truth table shown above when I manually checked the resuts. 
3. The circuit also performed accordingly to the results of my truth table.
4. C3C Terregnoli helped me to understand what I want to program in my UCF file.
4. I tested all 8 combinations and practiced my 2's converting skills by testing myself with the circuit.
